# INFO5100_002722399_Xinyi-Hu

This repository contains all of my 7 exercises (Exercise0 - Exercise 4, Exersice 7 and Exercise 9) and final project for INFO5100.

As for the final project, you can download the whole "FinalProject" folder and open it with IntelliJ.
And you can run it with no extra library required. 
The implementation video for the Final Project is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWdpHOUrq2Q
Please check the YouTube link if you don't feel like downloading and running it locally.

Thank you!
